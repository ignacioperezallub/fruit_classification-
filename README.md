<h1>Fruit Recognition System using Computer Vision</h1>
<p>The problem to solve is the construction of a fruit recognition system using computer vision. This involves creating a code that recognizes certain training images, applying certain filters and preparing them to form a database with which to compare each of the test images and thus recognize the nature of each fruit. This was made possible by implementing the Knn and Kmeans methods studied during the course. The Python OpenCV library was used in Spyder for image manipulation. The goal was to recognize fruits in supermarket boxes to streamline the checkout process. A prototype agent was developed that can recognize bananas, oranges, lemons, and tomatoes from photographs:</p>

<p>The main challenge was the significant variation in image features, so depending on the database used, the dispersion of data varied more or less, and consequently, the efficiency of the code. Therefore, to draw real and constructive conclusions about the results of the code, a considerable amount of time was invested in learning how to properly adapt and process the images.</p>
